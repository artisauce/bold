###Phase 1

Here's some important bits. To compile cmake in clang++, do "sudo update-alternatives --config c++"

and select clang++.

ALSO REMEMBER TO COMPILE ON LINUX AND WINDOWS. WE NEED TO ALWAYS VERIFY THAT IT IS CROSS-PLATFORM FOR OUR CROSS-PLATFORMING NEEDS.

Because I still haven't done that.

Instructions:

Arrow keys to move up left down right.

Press m to toggle big map mode.

Remember to have the "MAP MOVE" window selected when doing this, and to press X on the window when done.

To run, "./build/maptest"
